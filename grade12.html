   	<h5>Here is the <a href = "./index.html">link</a> to my first page about my plans for Grade 11.</h5>
		<h5>Click <a href = "./uni.html">here</a> to go to my third page about my plans for university and beyond.</h5>
		<p>In grade 12 I have chosen several courses that are either required or will be needed for entry to my preferred university, Carleton University. For my electives, I chose Advanced Functions and Calculus because they are required for Computer Science in university. I chose Physics because I find Physics somewhat interesting and I wanted to at least take one science. Lastly, for the electives, I took Computer Engineering and Science because I really want to learn about the hardware and software of computers. I also think that the computer science course should help me out in the future with university and give me great skills to put on my resume.</p>
		<p>Coming into Grade 12 I should have completed a summer CO-OP position somewhere and so hopefully it would have taught me some useful skills for the future. This year, I should really work as hard as I can because I want to try to achieve a 95+ average. I wish to attain that average because I would get the most scholarship money that way as university costs a lot, if I want to pursue a Master's Degree it would probably cost even more.</p>
